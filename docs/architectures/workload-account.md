# Workload Account Architecture

![Workload account diagram](../static/aws-workload-account.jpg)

## Overview

The Workload Account architecture defines a standardized, secure, and scalable foundation for application deployments within the AFT framework. This design implements AWS Well-Architected principles with comprehensive security, monitoring, and operational capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### Network Infrastructure

**VPC Design**
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Resources distributed across two Availability Zones for high availability
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: Public, Private, and Data subnets for proper workload segmentation
- **CIDR Planning**: Standardized IP addressing scheme compatible with Transit Gateway integration

**Subnet Strategy**
- **Public Subnets**: Internet-facing resources (ALB, NAT Gateway) with direct internet access
- **Private Subnets**: Application tier hosting compute resources without direct internet access
- **Data Subnets**: Database and storage tier with restricted network access

### Compute and Application Services

**Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
- **Fargate Integration**: Serverless container execution for simplified operations
- **Service Discovery**: Built-in service mesh capabilities for microservices communication
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on demand and performance metrics

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Layer 7 Routing**: Advanced traffic routing based on HTTP/HTTPS headers and paths
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Centralized certificate management and encryption
- **Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring and traffic distribution

### Data Services

**Amazon RDS**
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: High availability with automatic failover capabilities
- **Automated Backups**: Point-in-time recovery and automated backup retention
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Performance Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and performance insights

**RDS Database Subnet Group**
- **Private Placement**: Database instances isolated in data subnets
- **Cross-AZ Redundancy**: Database replicas across multiple availability zones
- **Network Isolation**: Restricted access through security groups and NACLs

### Security Services

**AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- **Application Protection**: Layer 7 DDoS protection and application-specific filtering
- **Custom Rules**: Tailored security rules based on application requirements
- **Managed Rule Sets**: AWS-managed rules for common attack patterns
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting

**VPC Endpoints**
- **AWS Service Access**: Private connectivity to AWS services without internet routing
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced data transfer costs and improved security
- **Service Integration**: Seamless access to S3, DynamoDB, and other AWS services

### Monitoring and Observability

**Amazon CloudWatch**
- **Metrics Collection**: Application and infrastructure performance monitoring
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging from all application components
- **Alerting**: Automated notifications based on performance thresholds
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into system health and performance

**VPC Flow Logs**
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Detailed network flow information for security and troubleshooting
- **Compliance Logging**: Network activity audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Network performance analysis and optimization insights

### Connectivity and Integration

**Transit Gateway Integration**
- **Cross-Account Connectivity**: Seamless communication with shared services and other workload accounts
- **Centralized Routing**: Simplified network architecture through hub-and-spoke model
- **Network Segmentation**: Environment-specific routing and access controls

**Egress/Inspection VPC**
- **Centralized Internet Access**: All outbound traffic routed through centralized egress point
- **Security Inspection**: Optional deep packet inspection and threat detection
- **Compliance Controls**: Centralized logging and monitoring of internet-bound traffic

## Security Implementation

### Identity and Access Management

**IAM Roles and Policies**
- **Least Privilege Access**: Granular permissions based on application requirements
- **Cross-Account Roles**: Secure access patterns for shared services integration
- **Service-Linked Roles**: AWS service integration with appropriate permissions

**Security Groups**
- **Application-Specific Rules**: Tailored access controls for each application tier
- **Cross-Account References**: Secure communication with shared services
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required access for each component

### Data Protection

**Encryption Strategy**
- **Data at Rest**: EBS volumes, RDS instances, and S3 buckets encrypted with AWS KMS
- **Data in Transit**: TLS/SSL encryption for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Centralized key management through AWS KMS

**Backup and Recovery**
- **Automated Backups**: Regular backup schedules for all critical data
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Disaster recovery capabilities through multi-region deployment
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Granular recovery options for data restoration

## Operational Excellence

### Automation and Deployment

**Infrastructure as Code**
- **Terraform Integration**: Complete infrastructure definition and management
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked and managed through Git
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline integration for infrastructure updates

**Configuration Management**
- **Standardized Configurations**: Consistent settings across all workload accounts
- **Drift Detection**: Automated detection and remediation of configuration changes
- **Compliance Validation**: Continuous compliance checking and reporting

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Performance Monitoring**
- **Application Metrics**: Custom application performance indicators
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: System-level performance and health monitoring
- **Business Metrics**: Key performance indicators aligned with business objectives

**Incident Response**
- **Automated Alerting**: Real-time notifications for critical events
- **Escalation Procedures**: Defined response procedures for different severity levels
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Continuous improvement through incident review

This workload account architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for secure, scalable, and well-monitored application deployments within the AFT ecosystem.
