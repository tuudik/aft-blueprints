# Centralized Logs Architecture

## VPC Flow Logs

![VPC Flow Logs diagram](../static/aws-centralized-logs-vpc-flow-logs.jpg)

## Overview

The Centralized Logs architecture implements a comprehensive logging strategy that aggregates VPC Flow Logs from multiple AWS accounts and regions into a centralized AWS Log Archive account. This design enables organization-wide network visibility, security monitoring, and compliance reporting.

## Architecture Components

### Log Archive Account

**Centralized S3 Storage**
- **Bucket Structure**: Regional S3 buckets for VPC Flow Logs storage
  - `aws-central-vpc-flow-logs` (us-east-1 primary)
  - `aws-central-vpc-flow-logs` (us-west-2 secondary)
- **Cross-Account Access**: Resource policies enabling log delivery from member accounts
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated data retention and archival policies
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS for data protection

**Multi-Region Support**
- **Primary Region**: us-east-1 for primary log aggregation
- **Secondary Region**: us-west-2 for disaster recovery and regional compliance
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Optional replication for enhanced durability

### Member Account Integration

**VPC Flow Logs Configuration**
- **Per-VPC Enablement**: Flow logs enabled on each VPC within member accounts
- **Delivery Destination**: Cross-account S3 bucket delivery to Log Archive account
- **Log Format**: Standardized flow log format across all accounts
- **Sampling Rate**: Configurable sampling for cost optimization

**CloudWatch Log Groups**
- **Per-VPC Log Groups**: Individual CloudWatch Log Groups for each VPC
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for immediate analysis and alerting
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention periods based on compliance requirements
- **Cross-Account Access**: Log Archive account access for centralized monitoring

### Regional Architecture

**us-east-1 (Primary Region)**
- **Primary Log Aggregation**: Main collection point for organization-wide VPC Flow Logs
- **Real-time Analytics**: CloudWatch Log Groups for immediate log analysis
- **Compliance Reporting**: Centralized compliance and audit trail generation

**us-west-2 (Secondary Region)**
- **Regional Compliance**: Local data residency requirements
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup log storage and processing capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced latency for west coast resources

## Technical Implementation

### Cross-Account Log Delivery

**S3 Bucket Policies**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aws-central-vpc-flow-logs/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": ["MEMBER-ACCOUNT-IDS"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**VPC Flow Log Configuration**
- **Log Destination**: Cross-account S3 bucket ARN
- **Log Format**: Custom format including source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and actions
- **Delivery Frequency**: Configurable delivery intervals (1-minute to 10-minute)
- **Compression**: Gzip compression for storage optimization

### Data Processing and Analytics

**Log Analysis Pipeline**
- **Amazon Kinesis**: Real-time log streaming and processing
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless log processing and transformation
- **Amazon Elasticsearch**: Full-text search and log analytics
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Business intelligence and visualization

**Security Monitoring**
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based traffic pattern analysis
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with security threat feeds
- **Automated Response**: Lambda-based automated response to security events
- **SIEM Integration**: Export capabilities for third-party security tools

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection

**Encryption Strategy**
- **S3 Encryption**: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS
- **Transit Encryption**: TLS encryption for all log delivery
- **Key Management**: Centralized KMS key management with cross-account access

**Access Control**
- **IAM Policies**: Granular access control for log data
- **Cross-Account Roles**: Secure access patterns for member accounts
- **Audit Logging**: CloudTrail integration for access audit trails

### Compliance Features

**Data Retention**
- **Configurable Retention**: Flexible retention periods based on compliance requirements
- **Automated Archival**: Transition to Glacier for long-term storage
- **Legal Hold**: Capability to preserve logs for legal proceedings

**Audit Trail**
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit trail of log access and modifications
- **Integrity Verification**: Log integrity checking and validation
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation

## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Log Delivery Monitoring**
- **Delivery Success Metrics**: CloudWatch metrics for log delivery status
- **Failed Delivery Alerts**: Automated alerting for delivery failures
- **Volume Monitoring**: Log volume tracking and capacity planning

**Performance Optimization**
- **Cost Monitoring**: Log storage and processing cost tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Log processing latency and throughput monitoring
- **Capacity Planning**: Automated scaling based on log volume trends

### Automation

**Infrastructure as Code**
- **Terraform Modules**: Reusable modules for VPC Flow Logs configuration
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for log infrastructure updates
- **Configuration Management**: Consistent configuration across all accounts

**Operational Automation**
- **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing capabilities for common issues
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup procedures for log data
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region failover capabilities

This centralized logging architecture provides comprehensive network visibility while maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency across the entire AWS organization.
