# Centralized DNS Resolution Architecture

![Centralized DNS resolution](../static/aws-centralized-dns.jpg)

## Overview

The Centralized DNS Resolution architecture provides a hybrid DNS solution that enables seamless name resolution between on-premises environments, AWS spoke accounts, and private hosted zones. This design leverages Route 53 Resolver endpoints and conditional forwarding rules to create a unified DNS namespace across hybrid cloud environments.

## Architecture Components

### Network Account (DNS Hub)

**Route 53 Resolver Configuration**
- **Endpoints VPC**: Dedicated VPC for DNS resolver endpoints with high availability
- **Outbound Endpoints**: Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints for forwarding queries to on-premises
- **Inbound Endpoints**: Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints for receiving queries from on-premises
- **VPC Association**: Resolver endpoints associated with Transit Gateway for organization-wide access

**DNS Domain Management**
- **Domain Strategy**: Organized domain structure for different environments and services
  - `on.premises`: On-premises domain resolution
  - `on.aws`: AWS-specific domain resolution
  - `*.dev.on.aws`: Development environment domains
- **Resolver Rules**: Conditional forwarding rules shared across the organization

### Shared Account Integration

**On-Premises DNS Server**
- **Domain Controller**: Windows-based DNS server hosting on-premises domains
- **Conditional Forwarding**: Forward AWS domain queries to Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Connected via AWS Direct Connect or VPN for reliable DNS resolution

**Transit Gateway Integration**
- **Centralized Routing**: DNS traffic routed through Transit Gateway for all spoke accounts
- **Shared Resolver Rules**: Organization-wide DNS rules distributed to all member accounts
- **Network Segmentation**: DNS traffic isolation while maintaining resolution capabilities

### Spoke Account Architecture

**AWS Spoke Accounts**
- **Shared Resolver Rules**: Inherited DNS forwarding rules from the central Network Account
- **Local Private Hosted Zones**: Account-specific private hosted zones for local resources
- **Cross-Account Resolution**: Ability to resolve names across different AWS accounts

**Development Account Integration**
- **Environment-Specific Domains**: Dedicated subdomain structure for development resources
- **Private Hosted Zone**: `dev.on.aws` private hosted zone for development-specific resources
- **Conditional Forwarding**: Automatic forwarding of non-local queries to central DNS infrastructure

### Private Hosted Zone Strategy

**Domain Hierarchy**
- **Root Domain**: `on.aws` for AWS-specific resources
- **Environment Subdomains**: 
  - `prod.on.aws` for production resources
  - `stage.on.aws` for staging resources  
  - `dev.on.aws` for development resources
- **Service Subdomains**: Application-specific subdomains within each environment

**Cross-Account Sharing**
- **VPC Associations**: Private hosted zones associated with VPCs across multiple accounts
- **Centralized Management**: DNS records managed centrally while accessible across accounts
- **Delegation Patterns**: Subdomain delegation for account-specific management

## Technical Implementation

### Route 53 Resolver Rules

**Conditional Forwarding Rules**
```json
{
  "DomainName": "on.premises",
  "RuleType": "FORWARD",
  "TargetIps": [
    {
      "Ip": "DNS_SERVER_IP",
      "Port": 53
    }
  ]
}
```

**Shared Rule Distribution**
- **Organization-wide Sharing**: Resolver rules shared with all member accounts
- **Automatic Association**: Rules automatically associated with new VPCs
- **Centralized Management**: Rule updates propagated across all accounts

### DNS Query Flow

**AWS to On-Premises Resolution**
1. AWS resource queries on-premises domain (`*.on.premises`)
2. Query routed to Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint
3. Forwarded to on-premises DNS server via hybrid connectivity
4. Response returned through same path

**On-Premises to AWS Resolution**
1. On-premises resource queries AWS domain (`*.on.aws`)
2. Conditional forwarding rule directs query to Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint
3. Route 53 resolves from appropriate private hosted zone
4. Response returned to on-premises client

**Cross-Account AWS Resolution**
1. Resource in Account A queries resource in Account B
2. Query processed by local Route 53 Resolver
3. Resolved from shared private hosted zone or forwarded to appropriate account
4. Response cached locally for performance optimization

## Security Implementation

### Network Security

**VPC Endpoints Security**
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive security groups allowing only DNS traffic (port 53)
- **Network ACLs**: Additional layer of network-level filtering
- **Private Subnets**: Resolver endpoints deployed in private subnets for enhanced security

**Cross-Account Access Control**
- **Resource Sharing**: AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) for sharing resolver rules
- **IAM Policies**: Granular permissions for DNS management operations
- **VPC Association Permissions**: Controlled access to private hosted zone associations

### DNS Security

**Query Logging**
- **CloudWatch Logs**: DNS query logging for security monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of DNS resolution patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of unusual DNS query patterns

**DNSSEC Support**
- **Domain Signing**: DNSSEC signing for supported domains
- **Validation**: Automatic DNSSEC validation for enhanced security
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation and management

## High Availability and Performance

### Resilience Design

**Multi-AZ Deployment**
- **Resolver Endpoints**: Deployed across multiple Availability Zones
- **Redundant Paths**: Multiple network paths for DNS resolution
- **Failover Capabilities**: Automatic failover between resolver endpoints

**Caching Strategy**
- **Local Caching**: DNS response caching at resolver level
- **TTL Optimization**: Optimized Time-To-Live values for performance
- **Cache Warming**: Proactive cache population for critical domains

### Performance Optimization

**Geographic Distribution**
- **Regional Deployment**: Resolver endpoints in multiple AWS regions
- **Latency-Based Routing**: Optimal resolver selection based on client location
- **Edge Optimization**: CloudFront integration for global DNS performance

**Monitoring and Metrics**
- **Resolution Metrics**: DNS query success rates and response times
- **Performance Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into DNS performance
- **Capacity Planning**: Automated scaling based on query volume

## Operational Excellence

### Automation

**Infrastructure as Code**
- **Terraform Modules**: Reusable modules for DNS infrastructure deployment
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for DNS configuration updates
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Automated detection and remediation of configuration changes

**DNS Management Automation**
- **Record Lifecycle Management**: Automated DNS record creation and cleanup
- **Health Check Integration**: Automatic DNS record updates based on health checks
- **Service Discovery**: Integration with AWS service discovery for dynamic DNS updates

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

**Comprehensive Monitoring**
- **Query Analytics**: Detailed analysis of DNS query patterns and performance
- **Error Tracking**: Automated tracking and alerting for DNS resolution failures
- **Capacity Monitoring**: DNS infrastructure capacity and utilization tracking

**Troubleshooting Tools**
- **Query Logging**: Detailed logging for DNS troubleshooting
